      I'm a software engineer.
      I found my passion in graduate school, where I hold a
      Master's Degree in Chemical Engineering. My research was my
      first exposure to programming and I liked it so much,
      I switched careers. I love what I do and I hope to
      share my abilities as a Software Engineer.
