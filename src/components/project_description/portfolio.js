    This Portfolio Website
    <p>
      Yep, this is a React.js frontend-only web app. A 100% stateless
      one as well. There are a lot of templates out there, but I thought
      this would be a great
      opportunity to make another app and get more practice in React.js,
      new ES6 features, and SCSS.
