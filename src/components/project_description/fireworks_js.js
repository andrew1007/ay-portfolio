    <p>
      Fireworks.js is a fireworks simulator, written in JavaScript
      (ES6 syntax) with modularity and inheritance fully in mind.
      Is it my most technically impressive project? No, but I think
      it is, hands down, the most entertaining. I welcome you to try
      it out and see for yourself!
