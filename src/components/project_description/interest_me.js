      <p>
        InterestMe is a social media web app for users to share pictures
        with each other.
        It is my full stack web app that I created in two weeks.
        I polish and maintain it while I work on other projects. All of
        my core web development principles, layered into one web app.
        Its stack is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rails Backend</li>
        <li>React.js/Redux Frontend</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL database</li>
        <li>SASS/CSS styling</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
)

export default InterestMe
