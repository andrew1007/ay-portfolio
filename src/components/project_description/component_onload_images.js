      I was facing a problem with clunky image
      rendering, so I thought I'd share my solution
      with the rest of the React.js community. It
      handles actions before and after images have
      full finished loading. I used it to make the
      entire component invivisble until all images
      were sized correctly. No more clunky loading.

export default ComponentOnloadImages
